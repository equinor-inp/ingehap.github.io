  <code>
  1 Learn concept/method/result
    Read books/theses/articles
  2 Test understanding by experiments/projects
    Reimplement/improve/simplify/stabilize
  3 Formulate ideas and goals
    HDM or result/methos
    Transferable to other topics?
  4 Analyze trends
    What are the important problems in my field?
    What are the important problems of your field?
    Great Thoughts Time
    Simplification by abstraction
    Change your field of research on a regular basis

<H4>Research - general methodology</H4>

<pre>
  <code>
  1. Keep a notebook
     record your daily work, ideas and experimental results
     Every 1 or 2 weeks, do a review and condense into a summary
  2. Keep a metanotebook
     list of backburner ideas and projects
     review summaries: experimental findings, insights, implemented code, next steps / future work.
  3. Epsilon-greedy exploration
     one day per week on something totally different from your main project
     always work on one short-range, and one long-range problem, at the same time.

<H4>Research - How to read a paper</H4>

<pre>
  <code>
  0. General
     Steady reading, one paper a day
  1. Multiple passes at increasing depth
     title/abstract/figures
	 introduction / conclusions / figures / tables / related work
	 read paper, skip math
	 read paper, except part that does nor make sense
  2. Keep in mind
     What did the authors try to accomplish?
	 What were the key elements of the approach?
	 What can you use yourself?
	 What other references do you want to follow?
  3. Math
     Read, make notes, and re-derive from scratch on a blank piece of paper.
	 Derive the novel algorithms yourself.
	 Learn from the masters, not from their students.
  4. Code
     Lightweight: download and run their open-source code (assuming they have it).
	 Deeper: reimplement their code from scratch.
