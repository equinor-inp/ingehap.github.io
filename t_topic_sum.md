Faith is a personal relationship based on love

With language and symbolic communication, evolution is not only biological, 
but also social.

Adam is not the first biological human, but the first spiritual human 
able to have a relationship with God.

In order to bring forward beeings that are free to choose to love, both 
physical laws and biological laws were used. However, these laws also have 
a shadow side - natural evil:
physics - earthquake, tsunamis, ...
biology - virus, parasites, pain, sickness, ..
